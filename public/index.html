        <h2>Zoologist</h2> <br><br>
        <p> I’m studying Zoology at the University of Aberdeen—close to home and the perfect 
          fit for my love of animals and marine life. Alongside core science modules, I’ve chosen 
          language, computing, and accounting to support my interests in travelling, investing, and 
          programming. These subjects also tie into my passion for game design and investing, giving me a well-rounded 
          mix of science, creativity, and practical skills.</p>

        <h2>Animals</h2> <br><br>
        <p>Growing up, I spent lots of time outdoors and visited zoos and museums whenever I could, 
          eventually starting a fossil collection. My love for animals was shaped by a home full of 
          pets, a natural empathy for creatures, and a fascination sparked by books and movies such
          as jurassic park.

          <p>
            In my second year, I took the plunge—literally—and discovered a whole new way to connect with the water 
            I’ve always loved. Growing up near the coast, I’ve always felt at home in the ocean. As a kid, I spent hours 
            bodyboarding, and now, diving has opened up a completely different world beneath the surface. It’s sparked a 
            deeper appreciation for marine life and the environment, and I’ve met some of the most supportive, adventurous 
            people through the club. Next on my list? Surfing.
