          <h2 class="section-title">sports</h2>
          <p>
            Sports have always been a huge part of my life. Growing up, I was drawn to the thrill 
            of team games like capture the flag, hockey, and basketball. There's something about the 
            teamwork and strategy that I’ve always enjoyed. I also expanded my interests beyond 
            school sports, taking tennis and ping pong lessons, cheerleading and street dance with 
            my friends. Staying active has always 
            been a source of joy for me, whether it’s swimming, running, or even getting my dog 
            to join me for a jog on our walks (she much prefers it over a simple stroll with my 
            mum!). I also love hiking and hillwalking, taking in the fresh air and being outdoors. 
            Looking ahead, I’m excited to join more sports clubs at university, such as hockey or 
            larig, after trying rugby and lacrosse. I’m also eager to pick up horse riding again, 
            something that has always been a passion of mine.<br><br>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Gaming</h2>
          <p>
            In many ways, gaming has shaped how I imagine the world and what I dream of doing. 
            It started early, playing Minecraft alongside my older brother. That passion grew 
            into a love for simulation and creative games, like 
            designing parks or planning spaces with an eye for detail. Then came Red Dead Redemption 
            2—its rich, western landscapes and immersive storytelling sparked something new: a 
            fascination with old ranch life in the American outback or rural New Zealand. More than 
            just entertainment, games like these have inspired me to imagine a future where I could 
            help create these kinds of experiences myself—maybe even joining a company like Rockstar 
            Games, where storytelling and world-building happen on a massive, collaborative scale.

          <h2 class="section-title">Favourite subjects</h2>
          <p>
            Cake Craft – Convincing my friends to join me in this class made my final year of academy very entertaining and delicious, with the excitement of one day opening a bakery together.<br><br>

            Biology – Facts just seemed to retain themselves in my brain. Biology made more sense to me than physics and chemistry, despite my fascination with space.<br><br>
            
            Physical Education – I loved this class, picking up as many extra P.E. lessons as I could and participating in sports days.<br><br>
            
            Art – We were left to our own devices to paint and design costumes, with the theory linking to how people precieve colours, shapes and design.<br><br>
            
            Graphic Communication – This was also fun, especially as it incorporated architectural drawings.<br><br>
            
            Economics – I found this subject interesting, particularly the explanation of how large companies thrive, monopolize markets, and how trade works abroad.
